# Responsive-animated-icon-using-HTML-and-CSS
The HTML and CSS code I did creates a grid of icons with tooltips that change color and move up when hovered over. The icons include links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, and YouTube.
The HTML code generates a basic web page that has a head and body section. The head section consists meta tags and links to external stylesheets, whereas the body part has a div with a class of "wrapper". Inside the wrapper div, there are five more divs with "icon" classes and a different class for each social media icon. Each div has an anchor tag with a href attribute that links to the social networking site(facebook,twitter,instagram,github,youtube), a span tag with an icon, and a p tag that contains the name of the social media site.
The CSS code styles the elements in the HTML code. It sets default styles for all elements on the page and centers all items. It sets up the grid container and sets up the container for the icons as inline-flex. It styles the individual icon, including the background circle of the icon and the icon itself. It sets the color of the icon to change on hover and sets up the icon to move up on hover. It sets up the tooltip to pop out and the color of the text to change on hover. It sets up the shadow to appear on the text and tooltip on hover. It sets up the background color of each icon to change on hover. Finally, it removes default hyperlink styling and sets up the tooltip to display on hover.
